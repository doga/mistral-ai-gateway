# An HTTP(S) gateway for Mistral.ai's web API

This is a TypeScript application that targets the [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime.
This is a Bun application and not a Deno application because it seems that Deno-compatibility is currently not a priority for Mistral.

Currently using [one of the free Mistral models](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/models_overview/#free-models).
